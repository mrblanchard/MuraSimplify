# Mura Simplify

Mura Simplify is a plugin for Mura CMS, the feature-rich CMS written in ColdFusion. It enables you to customize the user experience of the Mura CMS administration area for different user roles, i.e: simplify it.

Mura CMS is a powerful CMS with a wide variety of built in features, but you might not want every CMS user to access all of these features, especially if they can unknowingly break their own website! Mura CMS has a built-in permission system which allows setting permissions for sites, content and modules. However sometimes a more fine-grained approach is needed. Mura Simplify enables this.

Mura Simplify enables setting the access to almost every aspect of the Mura CMS administration area. Including the navigation, site manager columns, content tabs and attributes. All of this is customizable per user group and per content type (class extension).

**Importent notice:** Mura Simplify is not a security plugin, it provides client side simplification through the use of CSS and Javascript, making the CMS easier to use.
