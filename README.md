# Mura Simplify

Mura Simplify is a plugin for Mura CMS that enables you to simplify the user
experience of the administration area for different user roles. It can enable
or disable a wide variety of features of the administration area, including the
main navigation, site manager columns, content tabs and content attributes.

## Minimum Requirements

- Mura CMS 6+
- Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer 9+ or Safari

## Important notice

Mura Simplify is not a security plugin or permission system. It simply tries to
make the administration area easier to use for authorized users. It provides
this simplification through the use of CSS and Javascript.

## Installation

Download the
[latest stable release](https://github.com/david-conde/MuraSimplify/releases)
to your computer. Login to your Mura CMS administration area and use the main
navigation to navigate to **Settings / Plugins**. Under "Install Plugin" select
"Upload file" and select the downloaded release. Click "Deploy to start the
installation". After accepting the terms of the license you will be brought to
the setup page where you can choose which sites to enable the plugin for and
finalize the installation.

## Basic Usage

Use the main navigation to navigate to **Users / View System Groups**. For any
system group except the "Admin" group select the edit icon or add a new system
group. On the next page select the tab "Mura Simplify" and start customizing
the user experience for this group. Any user of this group who logs into the
administration area will now only see the enabled features.
